        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> Crispy, golden chicken on the outside → tender and succulent on the inside.<br>The combination of your<br>dreams! Chicken breasts tend to have a bad reputation for being too dry, chalky<br>or hard to swallow. However, this recipe yields perfectly juicy breasts lightly floured <br>and pan fried.  </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>¼ cup lime juice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix olive oil, lime juice, garlic, salt, and black pepper in a bowl or resealable bag; add chicken. Marinate in the refrigerator, 3 hours to overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Transfer chicken from marinade to a shallow baking pan. Discard remaining marinade. Season chicken breasts with salt and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
