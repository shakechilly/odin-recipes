        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and<br>has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!  </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie</li>
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>8 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.</li>
            <li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.</li>
            <li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
        </ol>
